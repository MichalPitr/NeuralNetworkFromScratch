# NeuralNetworkFromScratch
My implementation of a Feed Forward Neural Netwrok using numpy. 

The implementation is heavily inspired by Michael Nielson's, I cannot stress how great, [book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html). I have added some features that are not in his implementation, such as vectorized computation, which reduces training time 5 times, and a method to visualize the learned weights as images.
